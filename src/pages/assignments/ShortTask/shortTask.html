                    By introducing the ultimate form of superiorness to the industry. How we achieve this is by telling everyone we're better than everyone, then they agree! We strive in our perfection in this because it works. No hired hitman, no bribes, no external resources are nexxiscary. Ultimately the compettition says that we're better and we win. Our links on the left do not work. The reason why? Because we're better than links! You dont need links! We dont need links! They're overrated.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We're hiring every day. All we require is a resume with at least 1 year of experience of telling people that you're better then them, weather it be profesional or hobbiest. No CV needed, no fancy dress either. In fact our hiring process is a step above any one else! We value individuality so if you come into the interview and tell us YOU'RE better than us, you're sure enough to get good marks by our hiring manager. Just make sure to remember to back up your argument why you're better than us, we're not going down without a fight!
