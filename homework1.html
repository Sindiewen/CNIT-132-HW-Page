                <p id="about-me">
                    My name is Rachel Vancleave, and I have many titles that identify who I am!<br>
                    I'm a full time Computer Science Student at CCSF, A part time Computer science tutor, and I'm a part time indiependent video game developer for
                    my own studio The Starfold Project. My ultimate goal is to be a software engineer at a video game studio, become extremely proficient in graphics
                    programming, and to get into the world of low level programming with microcontrollers and what not.
                    Eventually in the far future, teach computer science. I love bunnies, and I have 2 bunnies at home!
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    While web development is absolutely important for the future, it's not the path I wish to take ultimately. My future lies in low level
                    programming as I find that engaging. But why am I in this class and in the 133 class? Because it's a skill that is very useful! At some point
                    i'll need a website as a portfolio. <a href="https://sindiewen.github.io/" target="_blank">I do have my own website, linked here</a>, but it was
                    made using a open source markdown blog creater thing that I'm not a big fan of. So ultimately I want to be able to build my own site(s)
                    without need of any external site creators, and probably my own studio's website at some point.<br>
                    One of my favorite website's on the web is the very popular image board <a href="http://www.reddit.com/" target="_blank">Reddit</a>. A site where just about 
                    anything has it's own community and you can join smaller 'sub reddits' to discuss various topics. Such as Game development, software engineering, web development,
                    video games, music, 3D printing, etc... It kind of just goes on an on to just about any topic you can think of.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    One of the best resources we all have as students is the <a href="http://www.ccsf.edu/en/student-services/student-counseling.html#subcontent" target="_blank">The Student Counseling page</a>
                    that's avaliable on campus. I reccomend any student who needs a guiding hand to figure out where to go next in their scholastic journey. They're also great people if you
                    need someone to talk to.
